The follower application will make a simulated turtlebot robot follow another simulated turtlebot which is teleoperated via a keyboard or via the
rosserial node that publishes velocity messages to cmd_vel for that robot.

CODE STRUCTURE:

STEP 1:
	Create a TF Broadcaster to broadcast the frame of the robots.
	
STEP 2:
	Assign a TF broadcaster to every robot.

STEP 3:
	Create a TF Listener
		Get the transformation between two frames.
		Extract the distance and orientation
		Make the turtle2 move towards turtle1 using go to goal behaviour.
